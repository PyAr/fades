summary: system for automatically handling virtual environments
description: |
    fades is a system that automatically handles the virtualenvs in the cases
    normally found when writing scripts and simple programs, and even helps
    to administer big projects.

    fades will automagically create a new virtualenv (or reuse a previous
    created one), installing the necessary dependencies, and execute your
    script inside that virtualenv, with the only requirement of executing
    the script with fades and also marking the required dependencies.

    (If you donâ€™t have a clue why this is necessary or useful, I'd recommend
    you to read this small text about Python and the Management of Dependencies:
    https://github.com/PyAr/fades/blob/master/docs/pydepmanag.rst)
