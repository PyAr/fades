Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of\nthe HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.\nIt requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to\nperform the simplest of tasks.\n\nThings shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))\n    >>> r.status_code\n    204\n    >>> r.headers['content-type']\n    'application/json'\n    >>> r.text\n    ...\n\nSee `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.\n\nRequests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,\nmultipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the\nresponse data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3\n<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy\nhacks for you.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style SSL Verification\n- Basic/Digest Authentication\n- Elegant Key/Value Cookies\n- Automatic Decompression\n- Unicode Response Bodies\n- Multipart File Uploads\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Thread-safety\n- HTTP(S) proxy support\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install Requests, simply:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install requests\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation is available at http://docs.python-requests.org/.\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n#.

Broken in 2.8.0.\n- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a\n  Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.\n\n2.8.0 (2015-10-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)\n\n- Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the ``proxies``\n  dictionary to have entries of the form\n  ``{'<scheme>://<hostname>': '<proxy>'}``. Host-specific proxies will be used\n  in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the\n  previous syntax will continue to work.\n- ``Response.raise_for_status`` now prints the URL that failed as part of the\n  exception message.\n- ``requests.utils.get_netrc_auth`` now takes an ``raise_errors`` kwarg,\n  defaulting to ``False``. When ``True``, errors parsing ``.netrc`` files cause\n  exceptions to be thrown.\n- Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle\n  requests downstream.\n- Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now\n  contains only the requests version.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- The ``json`` parameter to ``post()`` and friends will now only be used if\n  neither ``data`` nor ``files`` are present, consistent with the\n  documentation.\n- We now ignore empty fields in the ``NO_PROXY`` enviroment variable.\n- Fixed problem where ``httplib.BadStatusLine`` would get raised if combining\n  ``stream=True`` with ``contextlib.closing``.\n- Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to\n  the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.\n- Miscellaneous minor internal changes.\n- Digest Auth support is now thread safe.\n\n**Updates**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.12.\n\n2.7.0 (2015-05-03)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see\n`our documentation\n<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/community/release-process/>`_.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer\n  encoding and response framing.\n\n2.6.2 (2015-04-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not\n  properly decompressed. (#2561)\n\n2.6.1 (2015-04-22)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.\n\n- Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to\n  pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. #2552)\n\n- Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to\n  the adapter. (#2503)\n\n- Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that\n  cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)\n\n- Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest\n  Authentication. (#2426)\n\n- Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an instance\n  of RequestsCookieJar. (#2527)\n\n2.6.0 (2015-03-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie\n  without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL\n  exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie\n  stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of\n  `BugFuzz <https://bugfuzz.com>`_. This affects all versions of requests from\n  v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).\n\n- Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python\n  setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)\n\n- Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the\n  vendored import location.\n\n- Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.\n\n- Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n- Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.\n  (#2468)\n\n- Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or\n  ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.\n\n2.5.3 (2015-02-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see\n  (#2455, #2456, and http://bugs.python.org/issue23476)\n\n2.5.2 (2015-02-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n- Add sha256 fingerprint support. (`shazow/urllib3#540`_)\n\n- Improve the performance of headers. (`shazow/urllib3#544`_)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove\n  requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those\n  same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party\n  libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having\n  to fallback to the system urllib3.\n\n- Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting\n  fails. (#2356)\n\n- Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)\n\n- Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication\n  challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (#2408)\n\n- Fix a socket leak. (`shazow/urllib3#549`_)\n\n- Fix multiple ``Set-Cookie`` headers properly. (`shazow/urllib3#534`_)\n\n- Disable the built-in hostname verification. (`shazow/urllib3#526`_)\n\n- Fix the behaviour of decoding an exhausted stream. (`shazow/urllib3#535`_)\n\n**Security**\n\n- Pulled in an updated ``cacert.pem``.\n\n- Drop RC4 from the default cipher list. (`shazow/urllib3#551`_)\n\n.. _shazow/urllib3#551: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/551\n.. _shazow/urllib3#549: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/549\n.. _shazow/urllib3#544: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544\n.. _shazow/urllib3#540: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/540\n.. _shazow/urllib3#535: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/535\n.. _shazow/urllib3#534: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/534\n.. _shazow/urllib3#526: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/526\n\n2.5.1 (2014-12-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Behavioural Changes**\n\n- Only catch HTTPErrors in raise_for_status (#2382)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Handle LocationParseError from urllib3 (#2344)\n- Handle file-like object filenames that are not strings (#2379)\n- Unbreak HTTPDigestAuth handler.

A ``MissingSchema`` exception\n  will be raised if they don't.\n- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.\n- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.\n- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.\n- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This\n  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on\n  the ``Session``.\n- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This\n  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the\n  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.\n- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.\n  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.\n- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding\n  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.\n- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``\n  exception to be raised.\n- HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``\"im_used\"``. Correctly uses\n  ``\"already_reported\"``.\n- HTTP 226 reason added (``\"im_used\"``).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n- Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb.

to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication\n  from the proxy url\n- Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s\n- Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes\n- Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the\n  ``Response.json()`` method\n- Don't send ``Content-Length`` header by default on ``GET`` or ``HEAD``\n  requests\n- Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request\n  took.\n- Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``\n- Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the\n  multiprocessing library\n- Update charade to version 1.0.3\n\nThe change in how hooks are dispatched will likely cause a great deal of\nissues.\n\n1.1.0 (2013-01-10)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- CHUNKED REQUESTS\n- Support for iterable response bodies\n- Assume servers persist redirect params\n- Allow explicit content types to be specified for file data\n- Make merge_kwargs case-insensitive when looking up keys\n\n1.0.3
